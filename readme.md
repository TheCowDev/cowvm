# CowVM üêÆüêÑ - 

CowVM üêÆ is a lightweight compiler backend written in C, designed to provide an efficient and easy-to-use platform for
compiling programming languages to machine code. With a focus on simplicity and performance, CowVM aims to be an ideal
choice for developers looking to generate machine code without the overhead of more complex
backend solutions.

## Features

- Simple API
- JIT mode
- Currently supporting x86_64 instructions set
- Bytecode Interpret mode available

## Example üì¢

Compiling a function that retus

```C
#include <cow.h>
typedef int (*JitFunc)();

int main() {

    // create the module
    CowModule module = cow_module_create();
    
    // create the function with no arguments and that returns an 32-bits integer
    CowFunc my_func = cow_create_func(module, "my_func", NULL, 0, cow_type_i32());
    
    // get the builder and start writing the instruction that return the constant 100
    CowBuilder builder = cow_func_get_builder(my_func);
    cow_builder_ret(builder, cow_builder_const_i64(builder, 100));

    // generate the machine instructions from our jit
    cow_module_jit(module);

    // get the pointer of the generate function and call it
    JitFunc ptr_func = my_func->jit_func.generated_func;
    
    // result will now hold 100
    int result = ptr_func(); 
    
    // clear everything from memory
    cow_module_free(module);

    return 0;
}
```

## Todo üìù

- Complete missing instructions (mostly operations)
- Support arguments
- Support the default calling convention for the platform
- Add basic instructions
- Add AOT mode (export module into an ELF file)
